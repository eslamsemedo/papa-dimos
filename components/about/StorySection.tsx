            <p>
              Founded in 1985 by Dimos Papadopoulos, Papa Dimos Restaurant & Caf√© began as a small family kitchen with a
              big dream: to bring authentic Italian flavors to Cairo.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a humble trattoria has grown into one of Cairo's most beloved Italian restaurants, while
              never losing sight of our core values: fresh ingredients, traditional recipes, and warm hospitality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Papa Dimos continues to be family-owned and operated, with recipes passed down through generations
              and a commitment to creating memorable dining experiences for every guest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is simple: to serve authentic Italian cuisine that brings people together, creating moments of
              joy and connection around our tables.
